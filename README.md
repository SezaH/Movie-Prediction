# Setup
- Download `movies_metadata.csv` (and others that people may be using) from
  https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset and put it in the
  `data/` folder.

# Usage
- `python main.py <part_of_program>` where `<part_of_program>` can be linreg,
  mlp, etc. Please keep this updated as you go along :).

# Contributing
- I have it set up so you have to create a branch and Pull Request in order to
  get your code into master. That way, between the 8 of us, no one will create
  merge conflicts.

# Things to do (feel free to add ideas here)
- Work on the writeup! Anything you can add to it for now. Doesn't have to be in complete form (bullet points, etc are fine. we could clean it all up in one night if we had to). Let the writeup guide you (ex: talk about a result, realize you need more info on it, go back and code some more)
- If you feel like you have nothing to do, ask someone on slack, or work on making sure the overleaf doc is up to date (check if there is any formatting / citations missing, any info missing from google doc, etc)

# What we plan to present (feel free to add ideas here)
- analyzation of the most useful features.
- graph of interesting features, like budget vs. vote average, budget vs.
  revenue
- A tool that suggests movies for users based on movies they like
- Our findings / conclusions
